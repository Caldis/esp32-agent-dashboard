 *   device → host:  "OK: <text>\n" or "ERR: <reason>\n" or "EVT: <text>\n"

 * Built-in commands provided by console_protocol_init():
 *   ?ping                 → OK: pong
 *   ?help                 → list of registered commands, one per line
 *   ?reset                → soft reset the device (esp_restart)
 *
 * Application code registers more (e.g. tap, ?dump, ?stat) with
 * console_protocol_register().

 * --- THE EXPLICIT-TAG CONVENTION (post-G-4) -------------------------
 *
 * Every OK: line that precedes a multi-line payload block MUST embed
 * `tag=<NAME>` somewhere in the body. The host-side parser
 * (esp_harness.core.parser.PayloadFollowsReader) matches the regex
 * `\btag=([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)\b` on the OK body to learn which tag is
 * about to arrive, so it can route the inner body to the right
 * consumer. Before this convention existed (gap G-4 in the
 * agent-dashboard project), consumers had to grep firmware source to
 * find out that `?help json` emitted HELP_BEGIN — the tag name was
 * implicit.
 *
 * Canonical forms used by built-ins and known consumers:
 *
 *   OK: manifest follows tag=HELP        (?help json)
 *   OK: scene manifest follows tag=SCENES (scene list)
 *   OK: dump start tag=DUMP w=N h=N ...  (?dump)
 *   OK: payload follows tag=HEALTH       (dash health, agent-dashboard)
 *
 * Free-form key=val pairs after `tag=` are encouraged — the host can
 * record them in the reply metadata for diagnostics (e.g. w_actual /
 * w_requested for ?dump when the requested size was downgraded). The
 * inner `<TAG>_BEGIN` line carries `fmt=` / `bytes=` etc. as a second
 * key=val payload; both are merged in the host's parse output.
 *
 * Legacy form `OK: payload follows` (no `tag=`) is still parsed by
 * the host helper for backward compatibility, but is discouraged.
